# MiniLooper

A barebones audio looper.

This is currently just a fresh start: yet another attempt to make something useful and easy to use for myself. The plan is to add a simple-to-use GUI, MIDI control support, and basic DSP with help from the Faust programming language. I also want a fast, frictionless way to bounce recorded audio to WAV files without going through an explicit export menu.
